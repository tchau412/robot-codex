# Frontend

This directory contains the React + TypeScript web frontend.

## Development

Install dependencies (requires Node.js):

```bash
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173` by default. It includes a page that fetches `/hello` from the backend and displays the response.
